Appends (or updates) a '## Usage' section at the end of README.md explaining how to import and use this new feature.\\n3. Appends a '### Scanner API' section in README.md that documents a new optional 'options' parameter for the scanner with a short code snippet.\\n4. At the end of scanner.js, append JSDoc comments and a helper function: \\n   export function initScanner(options = {}) { /* TODO implement */ }\\n   (add these lines after the current last line, do not remove anything).\\n\\nConstraints:\\n* Only **add** lines; do not delete or modify existing ones (no lines starting with '-').\\n* Only modify README.md and scanner.js in addition to creating the new feature file.\\n* Keep changes minimal, safe, and idempotent (running again should not duplicate content).\\n\\nExample usage for README:\\n\\n```js\\nimport { feature1_2_26 } from './src/feature-1.2.26';\\n\\nfeature1_2_26();\\n```"
